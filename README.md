# Skinfriend - Capstone Project Bangkit Academy 2024 Batch 2
A lot of people deal with skin problems, and they end up trying skincare items without knowing what works best for their facial skin needs. This lack of clarity can lead to wasted resources and the risk of skin problems. Our application named Skinfriend aims to tackle this challenge by offering skin care suggestions through an application that utilizes artificial intelligence and facial scanning techniques.

Our main focus is understanding how to select skincare products based on different types of facial skin and conditions that individuals may have. We plan to investigate the skincare requirements and preferences of users while examining the components of products and suggesting solutions that address their issues.
